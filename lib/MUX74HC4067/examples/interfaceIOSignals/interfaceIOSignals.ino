/**
 * This example demonstrates how to combine reading inputs and writing
 * outputs, whether they are digital or analog
 * It assumes there are 2 push buttons with pullup resistors connected
 * to channels C0 and C1, 2 potentiometers connected to channels C2
 * and C3, and 4 LEDs+resistors with the positive lead of the LEDs 
 * connected to channels C4 to C7
 * PIN A0 is used for reading the inputs and should connect to the SIG pin
 * PIN 3 is used for writing the outputs and should connect to the SIG pin
 * Connecting both PIN A0 and PIN 3 to the SIG pin won't create a problem
 * because when the pins are not used, they are declared as inputs which 
 * puts them in a high impedance state
 *
